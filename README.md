## About

This repository hosts an end-to-end machine learning project that goes from data ingestion / preprocessing, model training, evaluation, to deployment (or serving) via an application interface.  

The goal is to structure a real-world ML workflow within a reproducible and maintainable codebase.

## Project Structure

Here’s an overview of key files and directories:

├── artifacts/ # (Optional) generated model files, logs, etc.
├── catboost_info/ # Info (metadata) from CatBoost (if used)
├── notebook/ # Jupyter notebooks – exploratory analysis, prototyping
├── src/ # Core source code (modeling, utils, data pipelines)
├── templates/ # (If applicable) templates for UI / frontend (if serving)
├── application.py # Entry point for the app / serving model
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├── setup.py # Setup script (for pip installable package)
└── README.md # This file


You may expand or rename modules under `src/` such as `data`, `models`, `evaluation`, `utils` etc.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Python** (version, e.g. 3.8+ recommended)  
- Common ML / data libraries:  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - Possibly `catboost` (as suggested by `catboost_info/`)  
- For serving: possibly `Flask` / `FastAPI` / some web framework (depending on what `application.py` uses)  
- Other utilities as required (check `requirements.txt`)

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/H-Nandi-Prasad/ML-project.git
   cd ML-project

## Create a virtual environment (recommended)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## Install dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

## (Optional) If setup.py is provided and you want to install as a package:

pip install -e .

## Run the application

python application.py
